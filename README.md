# README

This project is for demonstration and play use only.

## History

1. Originally started as a prank.
2. The name was changed to move away from the target of the original prank.
3. The site was laid out as a convenient example of defining use cases for a
   website.
4. Used as an example when demonstrating the creation of personas when designing
   websites and applications.
5. Became a short story
   [Timmy's Zombie Abatement Service](http://bobtrapp.info/TimmysZombieAbatementService).
6. Extra chapters have been added to the story, gradually making the story
   novel-length.
7. The files were moved to github to make them easier to find.

## Notes

The project was orginally built using NetBeans even though it is a simple HTML
CSS project. At the time, NetBeans was the primary environment being used on
other projects, so it seemed reasonable to stick with a single platform.

As a result of using NetBeans, the site starts in the folder
TimmysZombieAbatementService -> public_html -> index.html

They want their website to accomplish the following goals:

1. Make their services known to the general public
2. Attract paying zombie abatement customers
3. Spread awareness and understanding of zombies and related phenomena
4. Sell related merchandise (hats, mugs, books, machetes, etc)
5. Improve their standing in the Professional Zombie Abatement Community

the visitor. The idea is to make a more concrete, relatable definition
of the target visitor. This can help communication between the client
and the designer.

NOTE: In the following personas, you will probably notice a rural, Midwestern
quality.

### Primary Visitor 1 - Hank

Hank is a 65 year-old farmer with a dilapidated, old farm. He lives alone since his wife passed ten years prior and his children all moved away. His dog has been barking at strange things in the collapsing corn cribs near the old pioneer cemetery. If it hadn't been for the cemetery, Hank would have suspected aliens.

### Primary Visitor 1 - Mary

Mary owns a four-plex apartment building on the outskirts of a small town. She has only had two tenants in the past few years. They've been complaining of something in the basement, and one has complained of a bite that won't heal. The basement has a door to the outside and the lock keeps getting broken. Mary doesn't want the police involved for fear of citations for code violations, but is too afraid to visit the basement herself.

### Secondary Visitor 1 - Jake

Jake is fifteen years-old, living in a house in a small town with his parents, two siblings, and their dog. He is in the ninth grade and only hangs out a couple of other boys who are not particularly popular. He and his friends are fascinated with the undead in popular fiction and often imagine themselves as the heroes in battles against evil. As the member of his group with the best Internet access, he has the responsibility to do research on their behalf.

### Secondary Visitor 2 - Sarah

Sarah is a sixteen-year-old girl in a larger town. She lives with her mother and nine-year-old brother. Sarah likes to dress all in black and read about horror with a preference for Gothic horror. Somewhat depressed, she claims a fascination with death and the afterlife. She is not really suicidal, but enjoys the drama and the attention that it gets her.

### Tertiary Visitor 1 - Dr. Willy

The doctor is a paranormal investigator with a popular podcast and couple of published books. He is always on the lookout for evidence of paranormal activities and interesting people he can interview. He or one of his assistants (usually young women who are far too interested in him, at least until they get tired of his attitude toward them) scour the Internet for possible interviewees.

### Tertiary Visitor 2 - Woodland Norman

Woodland Norman is predominantly a Bigfoot hunter, but has interests in other areas of cryptozoology. Anything that may indicate an atypical life form will attract his interest. When he discovers something new, or at least hears about the possibility of something new, he will discuss it at length with others like him. Norman belongs to several online societies and communicates with a large number of people, including some prominent persons with shows and books.

## SITE MAPS

This is a text only representation of the site map. It is written in an outline
form that is suitable for text. It should convey the idea adequately, though a
graphic format is preferable in a professional situation.

## PATHS FOR VISITORS

Define the preferred path for each type of visitor. This is just the optimal
path from the point of view of the client. The visitors will likely take other
paths, otherwise the extra pages would not need to exist.

Note: This is being done in a text format. It is often easier to read when
drawn as a directed graph connecting the pages of the paths.

## WIREFRAMES

    - Has descriptive text
    - Has sections with a summary and a link to a page with more detail
  - Story Page

      - History in this area -> stories
      - Our successes -> stories
      - About Zombies -> types
  - Zombie Abatement Store - displays available products
  - Product Detail Page - image and data about a single product
  - Checkout - forms related to purchase
  - Form Pages
    - Includes all contact pages

      - What to Do When Confronted
    - Items are ordered
    - Items may have images or diagrams
    - Items may be set up as a checklist that the person checks

**Do Low-Fidelity Wireframes for the primary types**

**Do High-Fidelity for a few important pages** (home, contact, product detail)
Remember, some people just mock up an HTML page with CSS for the high
fidelity version. Even if the client needs an image file of the wireframe,
you can mock up the HTML and send a screen capture to the client.

## NEXT STEPS

1. Write the basic format of the different page types, but without content
   or styling.
2. Write the content and gather needed images/diagrams/data for the pages. Be
   sure to use professional typing for web pages. Double check the spelling.
   Have someone else proof-read the content to make sure there is nothing
   embarrassing or wrong. If possible, get people from the target audience to
   read the content and get their feedback.
3. Write the HTML for the pages using the gathered content, but do not do
   styling, by copying the basic format for that page and inserting the
   content.
4. Decide whether your styling will be mobile-first or desktop first.
5. Begin applying style rules, starting with the home page and working outward
   using the site map.
6. Test the site on your local machine, making sure to check both the desktop
   and mobile versions for every page.
7. Get the client's approval and sign-off (to make sure you get paid)
8. Deploy the site to the production server.
